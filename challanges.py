"""
Beginner:

1:
Make two functions:
1. A function that checks if a list has more than 6 items. Returns bool (Boolean)
2. A function that uses the first function and prints if the given list has more or less than 6 items.

The lists:
[31, 123, 420, 69, 34, 89, 105]
[90, 2123, 3435]

Code:
















Hint: Boolean = True or False

2:

Make a function that counts to a given number from 0 including the given number

Code:



Hint: while loop


Intermediate:

1:
Make a while loop inside a function that prints the time (H, M, S) every second

Code:







Hint: When a while loop is set to true it executes until its interrupted
Use a function from the time module to make the cooldown (you need to import it)
Try using the string-formatted time function

2:
Make a function that checks how many names from a list start with the letter A

Names:
["Alex", "Trolli", "Linx1337", "Alec"]

Code:







Hint: .startswith()


Hard:

1:
Make two input fields in a function that ask the name and age.
There cannot be numbers in the name and there cannot be letters in the age.
Print the name and age in a sentence

Code:











Hint: You will need any() and map() combined for checking the str. You can also use a for loop
You can use .isalpha to check if a str has numbers and .isdigit to check if a string has digits in it

any(): Checks if something in a str, list... is an iterable(if something in the list == true)
map(): Makes a function apply to each item in str, list... if item is iterable
